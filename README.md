## What's this?
This is a Python script that allows you to play a very rudimentary version of [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) in [Minecraft]() using [raspberryjammod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod).

The game structure is inspired by this awesome [Snake clone](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-minecraft-snake.html).

## Why?
This is a preparation for [2016-05-10's Devnology Code Fest: Flappy Bird](http://devnology.nl/events/codefest-flappy-bird), and my first experience with both Minecraft and more than a few lines of Python.

## How?
Follow the instructions of [raspberryjammod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod) to install a suitable Minecraft, Forge, and raspberryjammod. Then, drop `fb.py` into the `mcpipy` directory in your `minecraft` folder, and run the script in Minecraft using `/python fb.py`.

You can move the bird up by right-clicking the glass block in front of you, using a sword.

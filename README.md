## What's this?
This is a Python script that allows you to play a very rudimentary version of [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) in [Minecraft]() using [raspberryjammod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod).

The game structure is inspired by this awesome [Snake clone](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-minecraft-snake.html).

## Why?
This is a preparation for [2016-05-10's Devnology Code Fest: Flappy Bird](http://devnology.nl/events/codefest-flappy-bird), and my first experience with both Minecraft and more than a few lines of Python.

## How?
Follow the instructions of [raspberryjammod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod) to install a suitable Minecraft, Forge, and raspberryjammod. Then, drop `fb.py` into the `mcpipy` directory in your `minecraft` folder, and run the script in Minecraft using `/python fb.py`.

You can now play the game by either "pressing" the button in front of you by walking on it, or backing off. Don't worry, there are glass blocks around you, so you won't fall.

## What's this?
This is a Python script that allows you to play a very rudimentary version of [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) in [Minecraft]() using [raspberryjammod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod).

The game structure is inspired by this awesome [Snake clone](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/03/raspberry-pi-minecraft-snake.html).

## Why?
This is a preparation for [2016-05-10's Devnology Code Fest: Flappy Bird](http://devnology.nl/events/codefest-flappy-bird), and my first experience with both Minecraft and more than a few lines of Python.
